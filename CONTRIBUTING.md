Chisel may appear as a small mod code-wise, but it is heavy in artistic content. It is very important that the textures which go into Chisel are of quality yet looks appealing when built in quantities. Pull requests are the only method to submit textures to this repo, however, please keep in mind that the resposibility lies on the person submitting the pull request to help upkeep quality through their textures submitted. Below are guidelines that will help drastically increase the chances of getting your pull-request accepted.

##How to get your Pull Request onto the Golden Road to being accepted

1. Use lower-cased letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes to name your files. Uppercases are no longer supported in the upcoming versions of Minecraft.
2. Ensure that textures used in a CTM will work together seemlessly, and will not have visible defects.
3. Do not include uneccessary files. Only `.png` files and `.mcmeta` files are needed. 
4. If a pull request adds a new block series, please explain why it would make an excellent addition to Chisel.
5. If there is an intentional discrepancy between the pull request and these guidelines, please explain the discrepancy. Otherwise, the error will be forgiven once it has been corrected.
